                        `<strong>Rebecca Begis is a traditional oil painter whose work explores the intersection of memory, emotion, and natural form.</strong> Born in Portland, Oregon in 1987, she studied fine art at The Evergreen State College, where she developed her foundational approach through experimentation, self-directed study, and close engagement with fellow artists.`,
                        `After relocating to the Midwest, Rebecca established her studio in St. Louis, Missouri, where she continues to refine her practice. Working primarily in oils, Rebeccaâ€™s paintings reflect a deep commitment to craftsmanship, intuition, and emotional honesty. Her work often draws from personal narrative and mythic symbolism, brought to life through impressionistic brushstrokes.`,
                        `In her studio, Rebecca is guided by a reverence for the slow and meditative process of oil painting. Each piece is built through layers of intention, allowing space for both evolution and surprise as the image unfolds.`
