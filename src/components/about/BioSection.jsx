                        <strong>Rebecca Begis is a traditional oil painter whose work explores the intersection
                            of
                            memory,
                            emotion,
                            and natural form.</strong> Born in Portland, Oregon in 1987, she studied fine art at
                        The
                        Evergreen State
                        College, where she developed her foundational approach through experimentation,
                        self-directed
                        study,
                        and close engagement with fellow artists.

                    <p className="max-w-3xl mx-auto text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed mt-5">
                        After relocating to the Midwest, Rebecca established her studio in St. Louis, Missouri,
                        where
                        she
                        continues to refine her practice. Working primarily in oils, Rebeccaâ€™s paintings reflect
                        a deep
                        commitment to craftsmanship, intuition, and emotional honesty. Her work often draws from
                        personal
                        narrative and mythic symbolism, brought to life through impressionistic brushstrokes.

                        In her studio, Rebecca is guided by a reverence for the slow and meditative process of
                        oil
                        painting.
                        Each piece is built through layers of intention, allowing space for both evolution and
                        surprise
                        as
                        the image unfolds.
